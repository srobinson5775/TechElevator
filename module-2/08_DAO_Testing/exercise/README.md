# DAO testing exercises

Designers of the `EmployeeProjects` database are enhancing it with timesheet tracking. They've developed a new DAO to handle creating, reading, updating, and deleting records from the `timesheet` table. For this exercise, you'll be responsible for writing DAO tests and using them to identify bugs in this new DAO. You'll then fix the bugs you've found.

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand:

* How to write DAO tests.
* How to use tests to find bugs in a DAO.

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

The instruction team evaluates your code for this assignment based on the following criteria:

* The project must not have any build errors.
* You must fill out the provided `BugReport.txt` file for four bugs you found and fixed.
* Each provided DAO test method must be complete and passing.
* Code is clean, concise, and readable.

## Getting started

1. You'll use the same `EmployeeProjects` database you used for the DAO exercises.
2. Import the DAO Testing exercises project into IntelliJ.

## Step One: Explore starting code

Before you begin, review the provided classes in the `model` and `dao` packages.

Also, familiarize yourself with the provided test classes and the `test-data.sql` file.

## Step Two: Implement the `JdbcTimesheetDaoTests` methods

In the nine test methods, replace the `Assert.fail()` with the code necessary to implement the test described by the method name. You can refer to the comments in the `TimesheetDao` interface for descriptions of what each DAO method does.

Use this unit's reading and the DAO tests from the previous DAO exercises as examples to reference while working. Static constant `Timesheet`s have been provided that you can use in your tests.

When fully implemented, five of the tests pass, and four continue to fail due to bugs in `JdbcTimesheetDao`.

## Step Three: Complete bug reports and fix bugs

Fill out `BugReport.txt` with information about the four bugs you've identified in `JdbcTimesheetDao` using the DAO tests.

### An example of reporting and fixing a bug

Consider the following `deleteTimesheet()` method:

```java
    public void deleteTimesheet(int timesheetId) {
        String sql = "DELETE FROM timesheet WHERE timesheet_id = ?";
        jdbcTemplate.update(sql, 1);
    }
```

A method written this way would contain a bug. It always deletes the record with a `timesheet_id` of 1 rather than using the value of `timesheetId`.

There are several ways this could cause the `deleted_timesheet_cant_be_retrieved` test to failâ€”for example, if the test called `deleteTimesheet(2)` and then found that `getTimesheet(2)` still retrieved the timesheet.

After that test fails, you'd fix the `deleteTimesheet()` method like this:

```java
public void deleteTimesheet(int timesheetId) {
    String sql = "DELETE FROM timesheet WHERE timesheet_id = ?";
    jdbcTemplate.update(sql, timesheetId);
}
```

Then you'd complete the bug report as follows:

```
Test that demonstrates problem:
    deleted_timesheet_cant_be_retrieved
Expected output:
    getTimesheet(2) returns null after calling deleteTimesheet(2)
Actual output:
    getTimesheet(2) was still returning a Timesheet object
How did you fix this bug?
    Replaced hardcoded value of 1 in deleteTimesheet with timesheetId so it doesn't always delete the same timesheet.
```

After you've found and fixed the four bugs, all nine of the tests in `JdbcTimesheetDaoTests` pass.

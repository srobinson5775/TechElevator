-- ORDERING RESULTS

-- Populations of all states from largest to smallest.
SELECT state_name, population
FROM state
ORDER BY population DESC;

-- States sorted alphabetically (A-Z) within their census region. The census regions are sorted in reverse alphabetical (Z-A) order.
SELECT state_name, census_region
FROM state
ORDER BY census_region DESC, state_name ASC;

-- The biggest park by area
SELECT park_name
FROM park
ORDER BY area DESC;


-- LIMITING RESULTS

-- The 10 largest cities by populations
SELECT city_name, population
FROM city
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- The 20 oldest parks from oldest to youngest in years, sorted alphabetically by name.
SELECT (CURRENT_DATE - date_established) AS age, park_name
FROM park
ORDER BY age DESC, park_name ASC


-- CONCATENATING OUTPUTS

-- All city names and their state abbreviation.
SELECT 
	city_name,
	state_abbreviation,
	(city_name || ' (' || state_abbreviation || ')') AS city_state_abbreviation
FROM city
ORDER BY city_name;

-- The all parks by name and date established.
SELECT ('Name: ' || park_name || 'Date: ' || date_established ) AS park_area
FROM park
ORDER BY park_name;

-- The census region and state name of all states in the West & Midwest sorted in ascending order.
SELECT (census_region || ': ' || state_name) AS region_and_state
FROM state
WHERE census_region ILIKE '%west'
ORDER BY region_and_state;


-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

-- Average population across all the states. Note the use of alias, common with aggregated values.
SELECT AVG(population) AS avg_state_population
FROM state;

-- Total population in the West and South census regions
SELECT SUM(population) AS west_south_population
FROM state
WHERE census_region = 'west' OR census_region = 'South';

-- The number of cities with populations greater than 1 million
SELECT COUNT(population) AS big_cities_count
FROM city
WHERE population > 1000000

-- The number of state nicknames.
SELECT 
	COUNT(state_nickname) AS nickname_count, 
	COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM state;

-- The area of the smallest and largest parks.
SELECT 
	MIN(area) AS smallest,
	MAX(area) AS largest
FROM park;


-- GROUP BY

-- Count the number of cities in each state, ordered from most cities to least.
SELECT
	COUNT(city)
FROM state
ORDER BY 


-- Determine the average park area depending upon whether parks allow camping or not.
SELECT
	has_camping
	AVG(area) AS avg_park_area
FROM park
GROUP BY has_camping

-- Sum of the population of cities in each state ordered by state abbreviation.
SELECT
	state_abbreviation;
	SUM(population) AS sum_city_population
FROM city
GROUP BY state_abbreviation
ORDER BY state_abbreviation;

-- The smallest city population in each state ordered by city population.
SELECT
	state_abbreviation
	MIN(population) AS smallest_city_population
FROM city
GROUP BY state_abbreviatioin
ORDER BY smallest_city_population;


-- Miscelleneous

-- While you can use LIMIT to limit the number of results returned by a query,
-- it's recommended to use OFFSET and FETCH if you want to get
-- "pages" of results.
-- For instance, to get the first 10 rows in the city table
-- ordered by the name, you could use the following query.
-- (Skip 0 rows, and return only the first 10 rows from the sorted result set.)

--TODO: COVER AS BONUS MATERIAL


-- SUBQUERIES (optional)

-- Include state name rather than the state abbreviation while counting the number of cities in each state,


-- Include the names of the smallest and largest parks


-- List the capital cities for the states in the Northeast census region.
SELECT * FROM city;
SELECT * FROM state;


SELECT
	state_abbreviation,
	city_name
FROM city
WHERE city_id IN

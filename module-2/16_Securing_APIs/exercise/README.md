# Authentication exercise (Java)

In this exercise, you'll continue to work on to the auctions server and client applications. Now that the API and client work, you'll add authentication and authorization to them.

## Step One: Open client and server applications

Before you begin, open both the client and server starter code in IntelliJ. Review both projects. The code likely looks familiar to you as it's a continuation of previous exercises.

### Security

The server application contains a package called `com.techelevator.auctions.security` that contains all of the security-related code. You won't need to modify any code in this package.

### Tests

There are test classes in both the client and server application.

#### Client application

In the client application, there are two test classes located in `/src/test/java/com/techelevator/services`:

- `AuthenticationServiceTests.java`
- `AuctionServiceTests.java`

Each class has a single test. The two tests fail before you implement any changes. To complete this exercise, all tests must pass.

#### Server application

In the server application, there's one test class located in `/src/test/java/com/techelevator/auctions/controller` with a total of six tests:

- `AuctionControllerTests.java`

These tests fail before you implement any changes. To complete this exercise, all tests must pass.

## Step Two: Complete the login method

In the client project, open `AuthenticationService.java`, and locate the `login()` method.

Most of the code is there, but you have to handle sending the request and processing the response. You need to send a `POST` request to the login endpoint `/login` with an object that has `username` and `password` fields and the appropriate header. Set the `token` variable to the token received in the response.

After you complete this step, the `step2_loginMethod` test in `AuthenticationServiceTests` passes.

> Note: If you're having trouble with this, you can go back to the tutorial and see what the `login()` method looks like.

At any point during the exercise, you can test the client application by logging in with the following credentials as the username and password:

- `user/password`: Role: USER
- `creator/password`: Role: CREATOR
- `admin/admin`: Role: ADMIN

## Step Three: Get an auction

In the client project, open `AuctionService.java`, and locate the `getAuction()` method. Again, most of the code is there, but you have to send the request and process the response.

Send a `GET` request to the server endpoint `/auctions/{id}`, replacing `{id}` with the ID of the auction to retrieve. This request must contain the authorization header needed to verify the identify of the request. Set the `auction` variable to the auction received in the response.

After you complete this step, the `step3_getAuction` test in `AuctionServiceTests` passes.

## Step Four: Add authentication to controller methods

In the server project, open `AuctionController.java`. All methods must require authentication except `list()`, the method that responds to `/auctions`. See if you can accomplish this by only adding two lines to the class.

After you complete this step, the `step4_AllMethods_ExpectUnauthorized` and `step4_list_ExpectOk` tests in `AuctionControllerTests` pass.

## Step Five: Add authorization roles

In `AuctionController.java`, add the following authorization rules:

- `create()`: allow `CREATOR` and `ADMIN` roles
- `update()`: allow `CREATOR` and `ADMIN` roles
- `delete()`: allow `ADMIN` role

After you complete this step, the `step5_CreateMethod`, `step5_UpdateMethod`, and `step5_DeleteMethod` tests in `AuctionControllerTests` pass.

## Step Six: Return user identity

In `AuctionController.java`, locate the `whoAmI()` method. Instead of returning an empty string, return the logged in user's name.

After you complete this step, the `step6_WhoAmI` test in `AuctionControllerTests` passes.

If you followed the instructions correctly, all tests now pass.
